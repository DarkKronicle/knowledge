YAML is a [[markup]] language that defines itself as being human readable. YAML stands for "Yet another Markup Language". YAML is essentially [[JSON]], but indents and dashes. I prefer using a language like [[JSON]] or [[TOML]] because I find some of the downsides of YAML very frustrated.

```YAML
key: Value
isThisTrue: false
hereAList:
- one
- two
- three
```

## Pros

- Simple to edit and read
- There are forks 
- Good for simple applications

## Cons

- Many ways to do the same thing, there are **63 different ways to declare strings** 
- Hard to spot incorrect indentation
- Different languages implement YAML parser with different rules
