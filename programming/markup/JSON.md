JavaScript Object Notation. This is a [[markup]] language that is pretty simple, and has strict definitions. This is probably my most used markup language because it can handle large amounts of data easily. 


```JSON
{
  "json": "is",
  "cool": true,
  "potentially": [
	  "mhm",
	  "yes"
  ]
}
```

## Pros

- Good for large data quantities
- Support for literally every language ever

## Cons

- Not the most human readable
- Not many data types
- No references
- No comments
