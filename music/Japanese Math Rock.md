Japanese Math Rock is a genre of music that is very similar to jazz. It was named because of it's amount of music theory and calculations done in writing the music. Even though it is named after rock, it is quite different from the hard metal that is typically associated with rock. 

## Favorite Artists

All these songs may not fit perfectly in math rock, but they are still *very good*.
