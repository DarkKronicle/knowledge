User Chrome is a way to customize how Firefox looks. It works by supplying custom CSS to the browser. 

## How to Use
1. To enable go to the URL `about:config` and change the setting `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` to `true`.
2. Click the hamburger button in the top right -> click on `Help` -> `More Troubleshooting Information` -> Scroll down and where it says `Profile Folder`,  click `Open Folder`
3. Create a folder called `chrome`
4. Put in any `userChrome.css` you want in there


## Themes

There are a *ton* of themes out there. You can see my cascade edit in [[My Theme]], but you can also look around the [Firefox CSS Store](https://firefoxcss-store.github.io/).
